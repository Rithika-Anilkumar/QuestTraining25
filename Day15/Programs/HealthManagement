// You are building a healthcare management system. You have two entities: Patient and Appointment.
// Patient: Stores information about patients.
// Id: Unique identifier of the patient.
// Name: Name of the patient.
// Age: Age of the patient.
// Gender: Gender of the patient.
// MedicalCondition: Primary medical condition of the patient.

// Appointment: Stores information about the appointments made by patients.
// Id: Unique identifier of the appointment.
// PatientId: The ID of the patient who has the appointment.
// DoctorName: The name of the doctor for the appointment.
// AppointmentDate: Date and time of the appointment.
// AppointmentType: Type of appointment (e.g., "Consultation", "Surgery", "Follow-up").
// Task:
// Using LINQ, write a query to find the following information:
// List all the patients (name, age, medical condition) who have an upcoming appointment within the next 7 days.
// Group the patients by their MedicalCondition and return the total number of patients in each condition category who have upcoming appointments.
// Find the patient(s) with the most appointments in the last 30 days. If there are multiple patients with the same number of appointments, return all of them.
// For patients over the age of 60, list the patient names along with their most recent appointment (doctor's name, date, and type of appointment).
