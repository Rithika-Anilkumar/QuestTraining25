You are working on a database for a schoolâ€™s student management system. The system contains a table named courses that stores information about the courses offered at the school and the students enrolled in them.

You have been tasked to generate a report that shows the following information for each course:

1.The total number of students enrolled.
2.The total fees collected for each course.
3.The course with the maximum number of enrollments.
*Write SQL queries to accomplish the following tasks: Find the total number of students enrolled in each course: The result should display the course_name and the total count of students enrolled in that course.
*Calculate the total fees collected for each course: The result should display the course_name and the sum of the course_fee collected.
*Determine the course with the maximum number of enrollments: Display the course_name and the number of students enrolled for the course with the highest enrollment

    student_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    course_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    course_fee INT NOT NULL,
    fees_paid INT
